# "Personal Page"

Developed in my software development class as a coding excercise to learn HTML, CSS, bootstrapping, and more! I had fun with it, so some of the content on the home page is a less professional (for example I have a worm-on-a-string as my "profile picture"). 

### Home Page
Home page shows name, a brief description, a picture and decks with my "interests". Also with the option to add a new interest. The interests have small "+" buttons to add a fake sample tweet about that topic. Adding a new interest leads to a page with a form to add an interest, however, this does not actually add that interest after clicking submit, as the primary focus of the assignment was a formatting a form. In the top right corner I have a github picture which links to my github profile, and at the bottom of the page there is a linkedin picture, which links to my LinkedIn profile. 

### My Page
This was what the home page looked like at the beginning of the semester when all we had learned was an introduction to HTML. To get back to the home page, press the back button. 

### Projects
A display of the projects I had done so far to practice slideshows with bootstrapping. 

### Sign Up Modal
Practice with regular expressions and updating information on the screen as input is processed. The checks at the bottom of the pop-up will turn green once the password matches the given criteria. 

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Exactly as it sounds. After entering the two names, one person will be assigned "X" and another "O". As you go through the turns and submit the input, the game tiles are updated. If a player wins the game, an alert will appear at the top indicating which player (either "X" or "O" won the game). After pressing "OK" the board and names reset so that you can play a game again!
